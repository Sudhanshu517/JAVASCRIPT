<!-- Why typeof null is object?
Javascript mai bahut pahle se null ka istemal kiya jata tha aur specification mai bahut pahle typeof null ko object likh diya gya tha.
Many javascript writers consider it as a mistake.
But since specification is quite old and typeof null is defined object so earlier on which
too much old code relies on, so we can't change that. -->
